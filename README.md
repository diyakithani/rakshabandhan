# 🎀 Happy Raksha Bandhan  

Raksha Bandhan is a festival that celebrates the bond between siblings, a promise of care, a thread of love, and a reason to annoy each other for life (in the nicest way possible).  
On this day, a sister ties a rakhi on her brother’s wrist, and in return, the brother promises to protect her, though these days, it’s just as much about sharing ice cream and inside jokes.  

This little website is my digital rakhi. 
It's a way to send love, laughter, and a few personal touches through something I made myself.  
It’s got a glowing rakhi, fairy lights, a note for Papa, and 5 reasons you’re the coolest brother (yes, even if we aren’t the overly-mushy type).  

It exists simply because:  
- Distance or busy schedules shouldn’t stop a festival from feeling special
- My dad deserves a cute little gift 
- A website lasts longer than a WhatsApp message  
- And… because Baskin Robbins doesn’t yet make rakhi-shaped ice cream 🍨  

So here’s to family, shared last names, and finding sweetness in small things.  
Happy Raksha Bandhan 💖
